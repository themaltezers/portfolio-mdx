<Section>

**moment.** is a **simple and personal platform** where I share a **daily music selection**.  
The idea is to build a **living playlist** that evolves over time, becoming the **soundtrack of everyday life**.

The name **moment.** comes from the belief that music is more than just sound:  
it **captures moments**, **awakens memories**, and allows us to **relive past emotions**.  
Each track becomes a **memory marker**, freezing fragments of life into sound.
