<Section>

**FlipFlapp** is a **web app designed for football lovers**.  
It allows users to **easily create matches**, **invite friends or other players**, and **organize balanced teams in just a few clicks**.

I worked on the **visual identity** and designed a **complete Figma mockup** to establish the foundation of the **user experience**.

<AccordionItem title="Context">

The idea was born from a **simple need**: making it easier to **organize football matches with friends**.  
Too often, conversations get lost in **messaging groups**, making it difficult to find:

-   a proper **time slot**,
-   an available **field**,
-   and to create **balanced teams**.
